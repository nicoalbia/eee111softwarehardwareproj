My EEE 111 Soft ware/hardware project which includes setting up a filter on a live video 


HELLO!
I encountered a lot of bugs and problems that need to be solved from downloading dlib, setting it up, lots of typo and syntax errors.
Thus, I only included one filter yet. The simplest one. I tried setting the screen to black and white, adding objects, changing the color of the eyes but it ended up on a continuous loop.
Stillworking on it. Here is just to show you that the code is woorking perfectly on identying faces through face recognition.
